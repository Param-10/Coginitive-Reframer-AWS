## Inspiration

```
Every day, millions of knowledge workers face decision paralysis and overwhelming stress. When stuck in negative thought patterns, we often lack the mental frameworks to break free. Professional therapists use evidence-based cognitive models—but most people don't have access to that expertise at the moment of need.

I wanted to democratize these powerful mental tools by building an AI agent that combines Amazon Bedrock's reasoning capabilities with proven cognitive frameworks. The goal: make expert-level thinking patterns accessible to everyone, instantly.
```

## What it does

```
Cognitive Reframer is an autonomous AI agent that transforms a user's stressful or stuck thought into two evidence-backed cognitive reframes, each with:

1. **Distinct mental model**: Selects from 8 frameworks (Inversion, First Principles, Dichotomy of Control, 5 Whys, Outcome Forecasting, Cost-Benefit, Scaling, Premortem)

2. **Clear reframe**: One-sentence perspective shift that addresses the core stuckness

3. **Actionable explanation**: 1-2 sentences explaining why this reframe helps

4. **Micro-action steps**: 2-3 concrete tasks achievable in 10-30 minutes each

5. **Personalization**: Stores past reframes to memory and uses context to customize future suggestions

6. **Safety-first**: Detects self-harm keywords and provides crisis resources instead of attempting to reframe

The system learns from your history, making suggestions increasingly relevant over time. Optional follow-up scheduling helps users revisit and act on insights.

## How we built it

**Core Architecture:**
- **Amazon Bedrock Runtime**: Claude v2 for natural language reasoning and structured JSON generation
- **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore patterns**: Implemented Runtime (orchestration), Memory (retrieval), and Tools (Lambda functions)
- **AWS Lambda**: Python 3.11 functions for main handler, memory operations, and scheduling
- **Amazon API Gateway**: REST API with CORS, rate limiting, and request validation
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Three tables (Reframes, Users, Reminders) with GSIs for efficient queries and 90-day TTL
- **Amazon S3 + CloudFront**: Static website hosting for React frontend
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Designed system prompt with 8 mental model definitions
- Included few-shot examples for consistent JSON output
- Temperature 0.3 for deterministic, reliable responses
- Explicit output schema validation

**Agent Flow:**
1. Input validation and safety screening
2. Memory recall (query past reframes for context)
3. Prompt construction (system prompt + mental models + user context)
4. Bedrock invocation (Claude v2 with structured prompt)
5. JSON parsing and validation
6. Storage (DynamoDB with TTL)
7. Response formatting

**Development Approach:**
- Infrastructure as Code (AWS SAM templates)
- Comprehensive testing (unit + integration with pytest)
- Automated deployment (shell scripts)
- Security-first (IAM roles, input validation, encryption)

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python 3.11, boto3, AWS Lambda
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Infrastructure: AWS SAM, CloudFormation
- Testing: pytest, pytest-cov, moto
```

## Challenges we ran into

**1. Reliable JSON Parsing**
LLMs sometimes add extra text before/after JSON. Solution: Implemented robust parsing that finds JSON boundaries using string search, then validates required fields.

**2. Safety vs. Helpfulness Balance**
Needed to detect crisis situations without over-triggering on common stress. Solution: Keyword-based screening for self-harm with immediate crisis resource provision; clear disclaimers that this is not therapy.

**3. Memory Without Vector DB**
AgentCore Vector Memory requires embedding generation pipeline. Solution: Used DynamoDB GSI for temporal retrieval (most recent reframes); documented migration path to vector search with embeddings.

**4. Prompt Engineering for Consistency**
Early attempts produced varied output formats. Solution: Few-shot examples in system prompt, explicit JSON schema requirements, and low temperature (0.3) for deterministic outputs.

**5. Tool Orchestration**
AgentCore Gateway not yet fully provisioned in account. Solution: Implemented Lambda-based tool pattern that emulates AgentCore tool calling; designed for easy migration to Gateway when available.

**6. Cost Optimization**
Bedrock Claude v2 can be expensive at scale. Solution: Structured prompts to minimize token usage, output caps, and documentation for switching to Claude Instant (80% cheaper) in production.

## Questions Judges Might Ask

**Q: Why these 8 mental models specifically?**
A: Selected based on research in CBT and systems thinking. They cover major cognitive distortion patterns and are broadly applicable to common stress scenarios.

**Q: How do you ensure safety?**
A: Multi-layer approach: keyword-based self-harm detection, clear "not therapy" disclaimers, crisis resources, and encouraging professional help for serious issues.

**Q: What's the AgentCore integration story?**
A: Currently emulate AgentCore patterns in Lambda. Roadmap includes: (1) migrating orchestration to AgentCore Runtime, (2) using Vector Memory with embeddings, (3) registering tools with Gateway.

**Q: How do you handle hallucinations?**
A: Structured prompts with explicit JSON schema, validation of required fields, low temperature for determinism, and few-shot examples for consistency. We also don't ask the LLM to fabricate facts—mental models are provided in the prompt.

**Q: What about cost at scale?**
A: $131/month for 10K users. Can reduce 80% by using Claude Instant. Further optimization via caching, request batching, and output limits.
